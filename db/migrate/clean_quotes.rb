    text: "It hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails, to bathe yourselves
    each week in water that covereth your bodies, and to clean yourselves with
    whatsoever ye have formerly employed. Take heed lest through negligence ye fail
    to observe that which hath been prescribed unto you by Him Who is the
    Incomparable, the Gracious. Immerse yourselves in clean water; it is not
    permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been used. See that
    ye approach not the public pools of Persian baths; whoso maketh his way toward
    such baths will smell their fetid odour ere he entereth therein. Shun them, O
    people, and be not of those who ignominiously accept such vileness. In truth,
    they are as sinks of foulness and contamination, if ye be of them that
    apprehend. Avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian
    homes, and be ye of the pure and sanctified. Truly, We desire to behold you as
    manifestations of paradise on earth, that there may be diffused from you such
    fragrance as shall rejoice the hearts of the favoured of God. If the bather,
    instead of entering the water, wash himself by pouring it upon his body, it
    shall be better for him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion.
    The Lord, verily, hath willed, as a bounty from His presence, to make life
    easier for you that ye may be of those who are truly thankful.",

    text: "Even in the physical realm, cleanliness will conduce to spirituality,
    as the Holy Writings clearly state. And although bodily cleanliness is a
    physical thing, it hath, nevertheless, a powerful influence on the life of
    the spirit … The purport is that physical cleanliness doth also exert its
    effect upon the human soul.",

  # Some Answered Questions
  {
    text: "For material water does not purify the heart of man; no, it cleanses
    his body. But the heavenly water and spirit, which are knowledge and life,
    make the human heart good and pure; the heart which receives a portion of the
    bounty of the Spirit becomes sanctified, good and pure—that is to say, the
    reality of man becomes purified and sanctified from the impurities of the
    world of nature. These natural impurities are evil qualities: anger, lust,
    worldliness, pride, lying, hypocrisy, fraud, self-love, etc. Man cannot free
    himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the help of the Holy
    Spirit. That is why He says baptism with the spirit, with water and with fire
    is necessary, and that it is essential—that is to say, the spirit of divine
    bounty, the water of knowledge and life, and the fire of the love of God. Man
    must be baptized with this spirit, this water and this fire so as to become
    filled with the eternal bounty. Otherwise, what is the use of baptizing with
    material water? No, this baptism with water was a symbol of repentance, and
    of seeking forgiveness of sins. But in the cycle of Bahá’u’lláh there is no
    longer need of this symbol; for its reality, which is to be baptized with the
    spirit and love of God, is understood and established.",

    mankind in all conditions and perfections; that they may be physically and
