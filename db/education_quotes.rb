    text: 'The Teachings of Baha’u’llah throw light on so many aspects of human life
    and knowledge that a Bahá’í must learn, earlier than most, to weigh the
    information that is given to him rather than to accept it blindly. A Bahá’í has
    the advantage of the Divine Revelation for this Age, which shines like a
    searchlight on so many problems that baffle modern thinkers; he must therefore
    develop the ability to learn everything from those around him, but always
    relating what he hears to the Baha’i teachings, for they will enable him to sort
    out the gold from the dross of human error.',
